<b> Exercise 2 - creating a static map illustrating changes in population density in Europe between 2014 and 2017 using Jupyter Notebook.</b>
- Load the data and project it (Web Mercator).
- Calculate the percentage change in population density between 2014 and 2017.
- Classify the percentage change in population density into intervals with values ​​of -5, 0, 5, 10.
- Place data on countries and population density on the map, select a color map, adjust the geographic coordinates so that the map presents primarily European countries, ensure the readability and clarity of the map, place information about the data source in the lower left corner of the graph.
- Save the map to a file in PNG format.
