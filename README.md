# Spatial-Data-Analysis assignments

<b> Exercise 1 - proposal of a new potential locations for a chain of ice cream shops using SQL Query and QGIS.</b>
- The county must have more than 500 dairy farms, a workforce of at least 25,000 people (ages 18-64), and a population density of less than 150 people per square mile,
- The city must have a crime rate of less than or equal to 0.02, and a university,
- There must be an interstate highway within 20 miles of the city, and a recreational area within 10 miles of the city.

<b> Exercise 2 - creating a static map illustrating changes in population density in Europe between 2014 and 2017 using Jupyter Notebook.</b>

<b> Exercise 3 - creating an interactive map showing where the common raven can be seen in Finland in 2021 using Jupyter Notebook.</b>
- The first layer contains markers with a tooltip with the date of observation.
- The second layer contains a heat map of the number of birds observed.
- The third layer contains grouped markers with a description of the observer type and the number of birds observed, with different colored icons depending on the observer type, and different icons depending on whether one or more birds were observed.

<b> Project - finding locations for 5 new bus stops in Inowroc≈Çaw city using Jupyter Notebook. </b>
- This project responds to a hypothetical problem of the city authorities.
- The project includes the analysis of statistics on the researched topic and various types of spatial data analyses - static and interactive maps.
- The research results are presented in a clear, transparent and visually attractive way.
